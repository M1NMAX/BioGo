# BioGo

This project aimed to collect data about available species in regions through a mobile game similar to Pokemon. The game consists of the players taking pictures of animals and plants at a given location and uploading them to be validated by expert users within the game. After the validation, the user receives points based on the species' rarity, increasing their rank position.
