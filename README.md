# BioGo

This project aimed to collect data about available species in regions through a mobile game similar to Pokemon. The game consists of the players taking pictures of animals and plants at a given location and uploading them to be validated by expert users within the game. After the validation, the user receives points based on the species' rarity, increasing their rank position. 


## Technologies
- Firebase:  Utilized for authentication, Cloud Storage (for user-uploaded pictures), and Cloud Firestore (for data storage).
- Android SDK, Java and Material UI
- [INaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) API
